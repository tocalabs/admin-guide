Identity Providers allow users to connect Toca with their Google, Microsoft, Facebook, GitHub etc. accounts. Once connected a user can take advantage of actions which require a connection to these accounts such as the Outlook actions or Google Drive actions. You can connect any account that supports OpenID Connect protocol [[https://openid.net/connect/](https://openid.net/connect/)]. 

The Identity Providers can be accessed by clicking on the Identity Providers icon in the Admin Panel.

#### Add Identity Provider

The setup is performed in three steps, on both Toca and the providers side:


- Get a Redirect URI from Toca. This URI is generated by Toca to identify the source of each login request to the provider.


- Using the Redirect URI, generate a Client ID and Secret in the provider's API Manager (e.g. https://portal.azure.com for Microsoft and https://console.developers.google.com for Google). Every login request sent from Toca to the Provider includes a unique identifier. The ID and secret you store in the authentication module tell the Provider that each login request is authorised.




- Provide the Client ID and Secret to Toca. When you have generated the Client ID and Secret in the provider's API Manager, provide these values to Toca along with the Token endpoint and the Auth endpoint.


# Editing and Removing Listeners (Administrator)



 
As Listeners open up your platform to external parties, a list of all currently active Listeners on the platform are included in the Admin panel. This lets an administrator remove any Listeners if they are being abused or are no longer needed.
To view all the currently active Listeners on the platform go to the Admin panel and click on the Listeners section.

This view shows you the name of the listener, whether it is public or private, what workflow it is attached to and finally when it was last updated.

#### Edit Listeners

If you wish to edit a listener to remove an API key or make it private rather than public then identify the listener you want to change and click the pencil icon.

Once you have made the appropriate changes, click SAVE. It is always good to convey any changes you made to the user who created the Listener.

#### Remove Listeners

If you need to remove a Listener as it is no longer needed or was set up incorrectly then identify the Listener in question and click the bin icon.

A prompt will appear asking you to confirm your action as removing a Listener is an irreversible process and it could affect Workflows which are being used.

Confirm you want to remove it by clicking YES and the Listener will have been successfully removed.

Before people in your organization can start using Toca, you need to set up their user accounts in Toca. When you set up a user account you need to:


- Create the user accounts.


- Provide users with access rights and permissions.


#### Add Users

To add a user to Toca, navigate to the admin panel and click on the Users icon.

This will show you a list of all users currently associated with this Toca platform. At the bottom of the Users page there is a button + ADD.

![Users 2](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Users%202.png?width=602&name=Users%202.png) 

Click + ADD to add a new user onto the platform. A window will appear which allows you to enter the relevant information for the new user.

Once you have added the email address and password for the new user you can assign roles to their user.
Typically, someone who uses the platform will have all roles except for the Admin role but you can tailor it to the needs of each user.
Once you have filled out everything appropriately, click CREATE and the new user has been created.

#### Modify a users roles

If you need to give a user new roles or revoke their current roles then first navigate to the Users section in the Admin panel.

This will bring up a window allowing you to modify the users information such as their email, password and importantly their roles as well.
Check or uncheck the roles you wish to modify and then press UPDATE.
You have now successfully modified a user\'s roles.

#### Reset passwords

To reset a user\'s password you can click the pencil icon alongside their user.

![Users 7](https://docs.toca.io/hs-fs/hubfs/Users%207.png?width=602&name=Users%207.png)
